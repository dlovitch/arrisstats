arrisstats
==========

Parse the stats from an Arris cable modem and make it available as a Python data structure. The CLI outputs as JSON.

Tested only on an Arris DG1670.

As my cable modem has been switched out, it's unlikely I'll update or maintain this (until I end up with another Arris modem).
